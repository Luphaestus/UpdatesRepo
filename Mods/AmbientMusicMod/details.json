Ambient Music Mod will download and install the latest Now Playing APK for you as part of the setup process.\n\nIf you have any questions, please [read the FAQ](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/AmbientMusicMod/blob/main/app/src/main/res/raw/faq.md) before opening an issue or replying to the XDA thread.\n\n## Building\n\n> Note: If you are building Ambient Music Mod yourself, you **must** also build Now Playing, since the signatures have to match for security reasons.\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Create a `local.properties` file in the root of the project, and set it up:\n```\nsdk.dir=<path to your Android SDK>\nstoreFile=<path to your keystore>\nkeyAlias=<keystore alias>\nstorePassword=<keystore password>\nkeyPassword=<key password>\n```\n3. Open the project in Android Studio\n4. Set the Build Variant to release\n5. Run and install a build of `app` as normal\n\n### Building the Magisk Overlay Module\n\n1. Open the project in Android Studio\n2. Run the `:ondemandoverlay:buildOverlay` task. A module zip will be built and placed in `ondemandoverlay/build/module`.\n\n## Sources\n\nThis repository contains a local version of [google/private-compute-services](https://github.com/google/private-compute-services) ([Apache 2.0 licence](https://github.com/google/private-compute-services/blob/master/LICENSE))\n\n## Read More\n\nRead more, including about how Now Playing works and how it protects your privacy [here](https://medium.com/@KieronQuinn/now-playing-ambient-music-mod-v2-93cd4042cc11)\n",
    "changeLog": "<ul>\n<li>Added new \"minimal\" widget in the style of the lock screen overlay (requires Android 12 or above). This is ideal for use on devices which support lock screen widgets, instead of using the overlay. This can be configured in the same lock screen settings as the current options.</li>\n<li>Added option to disable the shadow for the overlay &amp; new widget</li>\n<li>Enabled in-app predictive back where possible</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the screen on recognition trigger could be invoked while the main toggle was disabled</li>\n<li>Fixed a suppressed crash when using On Demand recognition on some devices, which was causing the recognition to appear to get stuck</li>\n<li>Various bug fixes</li>\n</ul>",
