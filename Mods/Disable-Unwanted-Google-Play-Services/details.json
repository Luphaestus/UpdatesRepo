BEFORE FLASH THE MODULE, PLEASE READ LINE CODES AND SELECT GOOGLE SERVICES YOU NEEDS. YOU ARE FLASHING THIS MAGISK MODULE AND ITS YOUR CHOICE TO DO IT OR NOT TO DO IT AND YOU'RE THE ONE DOING IT. I JUST WANT TO HELP OTHERS OUT.\n\n# What is the Module do?\nThe following module uses the Linux syntax '[pm/package manager](http://adbcommand.com/adbshell/pm)' command.\nFrom package manager, we can enable/disable any application.\nExample:\n>pm disable (any service want to disable)\n\n# Compatible Devices\n* Universal\n* Android 7 - 13\n\n# Does it work the same way as the magisk module Universal GMS Doze?\nNo, the way the Universal GMS Doze module works makes Google Play Services run in battery saving mode while Disable Unwanted Google Play Services turns off unneeded services.\n\n# Upcoming Features\n* Add key selection function for selecting disable service. (Meanwhile, if there are several services needed, you can delete the line code in service.sh)\n\n# Uninstall\nHere's how to remove the module:\n1. Delete module from Magisk Module list.\n2. After delete the module, download [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0).\n3. Copy script from [uninstall.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRedDragonICY/Disable-Unwanted-Google-Play-Services/main/uninstall.sh). Wait till script done.\n\n# Support\nif you like this project, you can give a star so that it can encourage me too (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)\n",
